## Important Note About This Project

**This infinite agentic loop project** was originally designed for "Claude Code" (a command-line interface from Anthropic) and we performed a conceptual migration to "MistralAI Code." However, the real **Mistral Code** is an IDE extension, not a command-line tool.

### What We Have vs. What Mistral Code Actually Is

| **Our Project** | **Real Mistral Code** |
|-----------------|----------------------|
| Command-line interface with custom commands | IDE extension (VS Code, JetBrains) |
| `/project:infinite` slash commands | Tab completion and chat interface |
| Multi-agent orchestration scripts | Code assistance and generation |
| Custom `.mistral/` configuration | Enterprise admin console |

## Adapting This Project for Real Mistral Code

To use this infinite agentic loop concept with the actual Mistral Code:

1. **Use the IDE Extension**: Install Mistral Code in VS Code or JetBrains
2. **Adapt the Generation Logic**: Convert the command scripts to use Mistral Code's API
3. **Leverage Mistral's Models**: Use Codestral, Devstral, and Mistral Medium through the platform
4. **Enterprise Integration**: Deploy through Mistral's enterprise platform for production use

## Next Steps

1. **Try Mistral Code**: Install the IDE extension to experience the real product
2. **Request Enterprise Access**: Contact Mistral for production deployment
3. **Adapt This Project**: Convert the infinite loop patterns to work with Mistral's actual APIs
4. **Explore Integration**: Use Mistral's platform capabilities for multi-agent orchestration
