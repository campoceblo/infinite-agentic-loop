# MistralAI Code Fresh Tutorials

## Getting Started with MistralAI Code

MistralAI Code provides a powerful interface for AI-assisted development with custom commands and parallel agent orchestration.

### Installation and Setup

1. Install MistralAI Code CLI
2. Configure your workspace with `.mistral/` directory
3. Set up permissions in `.mistral/settings.json`
4. Create custom commands in `.mistral/commands/`

### Custom Commands

MistralAI Code supports custom commands that can be defined in markdown files within the `.mistral/commands/` directory.

#### Command Structure

```markdown
**COMMAND NAME**

**Variables:**
variable_name: $ARGUMENTS

**ARGUMENTS PARSING:**
Parse arguments from "$ARGUMENTS"

**EXECUTION PHASES:**
1. Analysis Phase
2. Planning Phase
3. Execution Phase
```

### Parallel Agent Orchestration

MistralAI Code excels at orchestrating multiple AI agents in parallel:

- Use `create_and_run_task` for parallel execution
- Manage context across multiple agents
- Coordinate outputs and prevent conflicts
- Handle wave-based generation for infinite mode

### Best Practices

1. **Context Management**: Keep track of context usage across agents
2. **Task Distribution**: Assign unique creative directions to each agent
3. **Quality Control**: Implement validation mechanisms for parallel outputs
4. **Error Handling**: Plan for agent failures and reassignment strategies

### Infinite Agentic Loop Pattern

The infinite agentic loop pattern allows for:
- Continuous content generation
- Progressive sophistication across waves
- Efficient resource utilization
- Scalable parallel processing

This pattern is particularly effective for:
- Content generation tasks
- UI component creation
- Code iteration and improvement
- Creative exploration projects
